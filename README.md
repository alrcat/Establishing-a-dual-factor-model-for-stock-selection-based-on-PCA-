# Implementing a dual-factor model for stock selection based on PCA algorithm

## Introduction
Continue to upload the code implementation of the two-factor pricing model paper series on Huatai Securities-Jingong in-depth research

## Instructions for use
Paper numbers are marked with Arabic numerals (such as "1."). The same number may correspond to different codes (the difference in codes will be marked)

### Changelog更新日志
1.Version 1 briefly implemented the market factor, roughly took the style factor, and combined the two-factor model

1.version1简要实现了市场因子，粗略取了风格因子，组合了双因子模型

1.Version 2 found the error in version 1, and used the year-on-year sequence in 2 to mainly implement the market factor, use the front ex-rights closing data, the chart is more complete, and the style factor and the combined two-factor model are deleted
   
1.version2发现version1的错误，在2中运用了同比序列先主要实现市场因子，运用front除权收盘数据，图表更加完善，删除格因子和组合的双因子模型

#  基于PCA算法实现双因子模型选股  
## 简介
持续上传关于华泰证券-金工深度研究的双因子定价模型论文系列的代码实现
## 使用说明
论文序号用阿拉伯数字标注（如“1.”），同一个序号可能对应不同的代码（会标注代码的区别）
## 持续更新中，欢迎收藏讨论
